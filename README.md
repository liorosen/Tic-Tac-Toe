Win Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions after each move and declares the winner.<br>
Draw Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw if all positions are filled without a winner.<br>

## **Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language used for game logic.<br>
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running and interacting with the game.<br>
