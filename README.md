Interactive Gameplay: Players take turns to input their moves, with the game board updating in real-time.
Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid moves, preventing overwriting of existing moves and out-of-bound entries.
Win Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions after each move and declares the winner.
Draw Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw if all positions are filled without a winner.

## **Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language used for game logic.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running and interacting with the game.
