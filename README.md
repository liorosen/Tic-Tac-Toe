## **Tic-Tac-Toe**
## **Overview**
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, providing an interactive experience for two players. The game is developed using Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to run and modify within that environment.

**Features**

Two-Player Mode: Allows two human players to compete against each other.
Interactive Gameplay: Players take turns to input their moves, with the game board updating in real-time.
Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid moves, preventing overwriting of existing moves and out-of-bound entries.
Win Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions after each move and declares the winner.
Draw Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw if all positions are filled without a winner.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language used for game logic.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running and interacting with the game.

**File Structure**

Tic Tac Toe.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the game code and execution cells.

**Future Enhancements**

Single-Player Mode: Implement an AI opponent for solo play.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI for improved user experience.
Score Tracking: Add functionality to keep track of player scores across multiple games.
